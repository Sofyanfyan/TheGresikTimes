                  <p>
                     CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new
                     son
                     and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far
                     beyond
                     the world of known physics.
                  </p>

                  <p>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been
                     created
                     in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A
                     potential
                     hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special
                     energy
                     that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a
                     prodigiously violent instant.</p>

                  <p>If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to
                     pole
                     and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
                     irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit
                     in
                     the
                     ocean.</p>

                  <p>“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around
                     it.
                  </p>

                  <p>On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning
                     of
                     the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.</p>

                  <p>Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a href="#">the first sliver of cosmic time</a> with
                     telescopes at the South
                     Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
                     detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called <a href="#">gravitational waves</a> — the
                     signature of a universe
                     being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of
                     a
                     second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his
                     colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.</p>
