      content: 'In a game of VALORANT, communicating with your teammates is crucial. Sharing any useful information with your team can mean the difference between winning and losing a round. While voice chat is the most common method of communication, there are times when you may want to communicate privately with a specific player. This is where learning how to whisper in VALORANT becomes a handy tool. VALORANT direct messaging feature, located in the bottom left corner of the screen, can be used to send private messages to other players. To use this feature, simply press CTRL+Enter, type in the name of the player you want to message, and then type your message. Press enter to send the whisper message. It important to note that whispering works slightly differently from regular text chat. When whispering, you will need to press CTRL+Enter instead of just Enter. This allows you to send a private message directly to the player you want to communicate with.',
